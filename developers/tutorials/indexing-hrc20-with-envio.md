# Indexing HRC20 with Envio

The goal of this tutorial is to easily create an indexer that tracks and analyzes all LINK token transfers on Harmony by extracting the `Transfer (index_topic_1 address from, index_topic_2 address to, uint256 value)` logs emitted by the LINK contract. This enables real-time insights into metrics such as the largest LINK token transfers. 

## Prerequisites

Before we start indexing, you'll need to make sure you have the [prerequisites](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/getting-started) installed. 

## Initializing an Indexer

Now that you’re all set up and have installed the prerequisite packages required, let’s jump into the practical steps of initializing the indexer and generating a boilerplate index to index the largest LINK token transfers on Harmony.

1. Open your terminal in an empty repository and run the command `envio init`.

2. Name your indexer anything you’d like (e.g. `harmony-link-transfers-indexer`).

3. Choose a preferred language, select `Contract Import`, and import from `Local ABI`.

> Note: Indexers on Envio can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript. For this demonstration, we’ve chosen to use TypeScript as the preferred language.

> Note: For the Contract Import feature, the `Block Explorer` option currently only supports networks with Etherscan. If the network doesn't have Etherscan, you can proceed using the `Local ABI` option. Choosing `Local ABI` option will allow you to point to a JSON file containing the smart contract ABI. The Contract Import process will then populate the required files from the ABI.

4. Head over to the [Harmony Explorer](https://explorer.harmony.one/), and save the ABI code from the LINK smart contract address as a file in the current working directory. For this demonstration, we've chosen to name the ABI file "abi.json". Specify the directory of JSON file containing ABI, for example `abi.json`.

LINK Token Contract address: [0x218532a12a389a4a92fc0c5fb22901d1c19198aa](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x218532a12a389a4a92fc0c5fb22901d1c19198aa)

5. Select the events you would like to index. In this case, we’ll be indexing the `transfer` event.  

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

To select an event navigate using the arrow keys (↑ ↓) and click the space bar once you have made your choice. 

> Note: Multiple events can be selected and indexed at the same time. 

6. Specify the chain the contract is deployed on, the name of the contract, and the address.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

> Note: If you are using a proxy contract with an implementation, the address should be for the proxy.

7. Finally, review the configuration and select `I’m finished` to start generating the indexer.

## Starting the Indexer

Now, let's run our indexer locally by running `envio dev` command.

## Overview of Generated Code

Once that’s all done we can take a peek at the files generated by Envio in our source-code editor, in this example, we’re using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Code Studio).

1. **config.yaml**

This file defines the network, start block, contract address, and events we want to index on Harmony.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

2. **Schema.graphql**

This file saves and defines the data structures for selected events, such as the `transfer` event.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

3. **event-handler**

This file defines what happens when an event is emitted and saves what code is going to run, allowing customization in data handling.

## Exploring the Indexed Data

Well done, now let’s explore the indexed data.

1. Head over to Hasura, type in the admin-secret password `testing`, and click “API” in the above column to access the GraphQL endpoint to query real-time data.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

2. Navigate to “Data” in the above column to monitor the indexing progress on Harmony through the events sync state table to see which block number you are on.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

3. Now let’s analyze some events. Simply head back to “API” in the above column. From there you can run a query-specific event, in this example `Link_Transfer` to explore details such as amounts, senders, recipients and values.

*Once you have selected your desired events run the query by clicking the play button ( ▶️) to gain access to the real-time indexed data*

**For example:**

Let’s look at getting 10 `Link_Transfer` events, and order them by the amount we would like to appear first (in this case: desc = largest amount), who it’s from, who it’s to, and the value being transferred.

<!-- <img src="" alt="" width="100%"/> -->

You can now run queries to explore specific events, such as the largest LINK transfers.

If you want to index more than just `transfer` events, such as holders and balances, you can select `Erc20` template option after running `envio init` command.
